Mono repo for all things laser-mace 

Names of each package should be fairly straight forward. 
`laser-mace` is the OG collection of various disparate utility functions. 
`laser-mace-engine` is the in development ECSY game engine (see docs/ecsy-loop-requirements.md)
`laser-mace-testing` is the testing ground for both of the above projects.
`peernet` is a peer to peer library I'm working on and plan to leverage within the engine.

All of these projects should exist in my gitlab https://github.com/ahoff-git/...
Some are private, out of embarrassment, but I am slowly working to get them more public. 

You don't really get a readme because this file is just for myself. 
I'm just writing this for CODEX to read. 😊
